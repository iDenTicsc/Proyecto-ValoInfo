# Proyecto-ValoInfo
Welcome to ValoInfo a website with his own API and Databaase for information about RIOT GAMES most recent game VALORANT in spanish. 
The main reason why I created this project is due to the necessity for all spanish speaker players to get information about the game without visiting official Valorant website.

As a junior web designer I choose to do this project to practice my skills in advanced frontend design including tools like (FIGMA, REACT, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript), backend including tools like (express.js, mongoose, MongoDB) and their integration together. 
I hope that new future programmers can learn from this project not only with my creation process, but also from the possible aspects to improve in this project. 

Also if a senior web designer find this repository and could help me to improve this project im open to constructive critics in order to learn more every day. :)

Have a nice day and hope you like it
